# Agile

Agile is great because it increases communication. But if you use it in the wrong way then say bye to your process

## Scrum - Standup Meeting

Scrum is great because it increases communication. Having it once a day is good enough.
Key take away

    1. make it short and finish it fast if there is nothing much
    2. dont force people to speak but ask question if you have
    3. dont make it a meeting
    4. try to make it become a area to discuss about current problem each individual is facing

## Flight Levels

My own term - use agile in the right level to increase the continuous communication in the right level of the company.
Skipping levels can make it hard to manage
