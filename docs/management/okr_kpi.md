# OKR / KPI

## OKR

I find that doing OKR is to evaluate the team's performance. The OKR should drive the collaboration within the team towards the same goal

## KPI

KPI is a metric to measure the performance of the person. I often use KPI to help motivate the person to increase their performance.

## How to set scoring

60% - OKR (Team base) - if win we win together

40% - KPI - base on the topic and their role
