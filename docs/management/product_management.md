# Product Management

## Pitfall to be aware of in managing product

### Not enough people spend enough time on defining vision and purpose

Sometime no one really puts a lot of effort on finding purpose and meaning of the product. This is a big mistake. If you don't know why you are doing it, you will not be able to make the right decision when you are facing a problem.

### Having a week propositions

If you don't have a strong proposition, you will not be able to convince people to use your product. You will not be able to convince people to join your team. You will not be able to convince people to invest in your product.

You can solve using the following method

1. Focus on user not the company
2. Be specific not general
3. Make it as unique as possible
4. Know advantage and disadvantage of your product

### Focus only on the product and forget the team

If you don't have a good team, you will not be able to build a good product. You need to make sure that you have a good team. You need to make sure that you have a good process. You need to make sure that you have a good culture.
